    <h6 class="docs-header">Welcome to my page, Ryan's Ramblings!</h6>
    <p>I have more than 10 years of experience in training, education, and enablement within the information technology and cyber security industry. I have the privilege to do what I love. I get to spend my time developing technical training content, nerding out in labs, breaking and fixing everything to find out how it really works, and build the training content people based on my adventures.
      <br>
      When I transitioned into the Information Technology world, I didn't expect to be this excited about it. One could say that my inner nerd has shown itself. Since then, I have delved deep into the topics of web development, programming, networking, and most importantly cyber security. I pass any and all knowledge I can to those who want it.
      <br>
      I believe what makes a great educator is not the knowledge they have, but whether they can pass that knowledge onto others. It is much harder than regurgitating information in the hopes it sticks. You have to relate it and make it applicable to their lives and experiences all through stories and analogies to help them retain.</p>
